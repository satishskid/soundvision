# 💓 Phase 1: Core Signal Processing - COMPLETE!

## 🎉 **Phase 1 Delivered Successfully**

I've created the foundational signal processing module for rPPG! This is the core that all other algorithms will build upon.

---

## ✅ **WHAT WAS CREATED**

### **File: `signalProcessing.ts`** (300+ lines)

Complete digital signal processing toolkit including:

#### **1. Frequency Analysis**
- ✅ **FFT (Fast Fourier Transform)** - Find heart rate frequency
- ✅ **Welch's PSD** - Robust power spectral density
- ✅ **Dominant Frequency Detection** - Identify heart rate peak

#### **2. Filtering**
- ✅ **Bandpass Filter** - Isolate heart rate frequencies (0.7-4.0 Hz)
- ✅ **Detrend** - Remove slow variations and DC component
- ✅ **Moving Average** - Smooth noisy signals

#### **3. Normalization**
- ✅ **Min-Max Normalization** - Scale to 0-1 range
- ✅ **Z-Score Standardization** - Statistical normalization
- ✅ **Interpolation** - Resample signals

#### **4. Peak Detection**
- ✅ **Peak Finding** - Detect heartbeats in signal
- ✅ **IBI Calculation** - Inter-beat intervals for HRV
- ✅ **Outlier Removal** - Filter invalid peaks

#### **5. Quality Assessment**
- ✅ **SNR Calculation** - Signal-to-noise ratio
- ✅ **Stability Metrics** - Signal consistency
- ✅ **Quality Scoring** - Overall signal quality

## 🔬 **ALGORITHMS IMPLEMENTED**

### **1. FFT (Fast Fourier Transform)**
```typescript
// Converts time-domain signal to frequency-domain
// Used to find dominant heart rate frequency
const { frequencies, magnitudes } = fft(signal);
```

**Purpose**: Identify the frequency at which the heart is beating

---

### **2. Bandpass Filter**
```typescript
// Keeps only heart rate frequencies (42-240 BPM)
const filtered = bandpassFilter(signal, 0.7, 4.0, 30);
```

**Purpose**: Remove noise and isolate heart rate signal

---

### **3. Peak Detection**
```typescript
// Find heartbeats in the signal
const peaks = detectPeaks(signal, minDistance, threshold);
```

**Purpose**: Identify individual heartbeats for HR and HRV calculation

---

### **4. Signal Quality Assessment**
```typescript
// Evaluate if signal is good enough for measurement
const quality = assessSignalQuality(signal);
// Returns: { snr, stability, acceptable, issues }
```

**Purpose**: Tell user if they need to improve lighting/stay still

## 🎯 **WHAT THIS ENABLES**

With this signal processing foundation, we can now build:

### **✅ Ready to Implement**:
1. **Heart Rate Detection** - Use FFT to find HR
2. **HRV Analysis** - Use peak detection and IBI
3. **SpO2 Estimation** - Use red/blue channel analysis
4. **Respiratory Rate** - Use low-frequency component
5. **Blood Pressure** - Use pulse transit time

## 🚀 **NEXT: Phase 2**

Now that we have the signal processing foundation, we can implement:

### **Phase 2: Heart Rate & HRV** (Next)
Files to create:
- `heartRate.ts` - Heart rate detection algorithm
