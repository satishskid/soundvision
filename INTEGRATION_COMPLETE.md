- ‚úÖ **AAO** (American Academy of Ophthalmology) - Eye health
- ‚úÖ **ASHA** (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association) - Hearing
- ‚úÖ **WHO** (World Health Organization) - Hearing loss classification
- ‚úÖ **NIOSH** (National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health) - Noise exposure

### Clinical Validation

- Evidence-based referral criteria
- Urgent referral for serious conditions (e.g., leukocoria)

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important Notes**

### Medical Disclaimers
1. **Screening vs Diagnosis**: These are screening tools, not diagnostic
2. **Professional Evaluation**: Abnormal results require professional care
3. **Not a Substitute**: Does not replace comprehensive clinical exams
4. **Environmental Factors**: Results affected by lighting, noise, etc.

### Technical Limitations
1. **Camera Quality**: Photoscreening depends on device camera
2. **Audio Calibration**: Consumer audio less precise than clinical equipment
3. **ML Models**: Face/eye detection uses mock data (needs real ML models)
4. **User Cooperation**: Requires understanding and cooperation

### Legal Considerations
1. **Medical Device Regulations**: May require FDA clearance for clinical use
2. **Liability**: Clear disclaimers about screening limitations
3. **Privacy**: HIPAA compliance for health data
4. **Informed Consent**: Users must understand limitations
