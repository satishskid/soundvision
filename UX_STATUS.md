## ⚠️ **Areas for Enhancement**

### **1. Progress Indicators** (Priority: HIGH)

**Impact**: Users feel lost mid-screening
**Solution**: Add ProgressSteps component (already created)

### **2. Real-Time Feedback** (Priority: HIGH)
**Current**: Basic camera preview
**Needed**: Live quality indicators, face detection overlay

**Impact**: Users unsure if photo is good
**Solution**: Add GuidedCamera component with overlays

### **3. Results Visualization** (Priority: MEDIUM)
**Current**: Text-based results
**Needed**: Visual charts, clear pass/refer indicators

**Impact**: Results hard to understand
**Solution**: Add charts, icons, color-coded summaries

### **4. Loading States** (Priority: MEDIUM)
**Current**: Basic loading
**Needed**: Skeleton screens, progress spinners

**Impact**: App feels unresponsive
**Solution**: Add loading components

### **5. Animations** (Priority: LOW)
**Current**: Instant transitions
**Needed**: Smooth page transitions, micro-interactions

**Impact**: Feels abrupt
**Solution**: Add CSS transitions, framer-motion
