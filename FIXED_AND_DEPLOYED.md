# ✅ FIXED AND DEPLOYED!

## 🎉 Your Health Screener PWA is Now Working!

**Latest Production URL**: https://health-screener-ql1833q7z-satishs-projects-89f8c44c.vercel.app

---

## 🔧 What Was Fixed

### **Problem**: 
The app was trying to use `better-sqlite3` which doesn't work on Vercel's serverless environment.

### **Solution**:
Updated `server/db.ts` to use **Turso (libSQL)** instead:

```typescript
// Before (doesn't work on Vercel)
import { drizzle } from "drizzle-orm/better-sqlite3";
import Database from "better-sqlite3";

// After (works on Vercel!)
import { drizzle } from "drizzle-orm/libsql";
import { createClient } from "@libsql/client";
```

---

## ✅ Current Status

**Everything is now working**:

1. ✅ **Database**: Turso (libSQL) connected
2. ✅ **Deployment**: Vercel production
3. ✅ **Environment Variables**: Configured
4. ✅ **Admin Users**: Added (devadmin-9792, admin-001)
5. ✅ **Authentication**: Working
6. ✅ **All Features**: Operational
